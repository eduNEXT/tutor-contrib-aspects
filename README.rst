OARS plugin for `Tutor <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io>`__
===================================================================================

This plugin controls the configuration of several different other Tutor plugins
to join them into the Open edx "Open Analytics Reference System", a way for Open
edX installs to collect and display learner data in a consistent way.

See https://github.com/openedx/openedx-oars for more details.

Note: OARS is in early development and not at all production ready! Please feel
free to experiment with the system and offer feedback about what you'd like to see!

Compatibility
-------------

This plugin is compatible with Tutor 15.0.0 and later.

Installation
------------

The OARS project can be installed in a Tutor environment with the following command

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/openedx/tutor-contrib-oars


Usage
-----

#. Enable the plugins::

    tutor plugins enable oars

#. Save the changes to the environment::

    tutor config save

#. Because we're installing a new app in LMS (event-routing-backends) you will need to
   rebuild your openedx image::

    tutor images build openedx

#. Run the initialization scripts in your chosen environment (dev or local)::

    tutor [dev|local] do init

#. (Optional) Load test xAPI data into Ralph/Clickhouse/Superset (with ``--help`` for usage)::

    tutor [dev|local] do load-xapi-test-data


Superset Assets
---------------

OARS maintains the Superset assets in this repository, specifically the dashboards,
charts, datasets, and databases. That means that any updates made here will be reflected
on your Superset instance when you update your deployment.

But it also means that any local changes you make to these assets will be overwritten
when you update your deployment. To prevent your local changes from being overwritten,
please create new assets and make your changes there instead. You can copy an existing
asset by editing the asset in Superset and selecting "Save As" to save it to a new name.

Define you own superset assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To programatically define custom superset assets there is a patch you can use with an
inline plugin. The patch ``superset-extra-assets`` will allow you to define your
own superset assets in a yaml file and have them automatically imported into superset
when you run ``tutor [dev|local|k8s] init -l oars``.

An example of this patch is provided as reference:

..  code-block:: yaml

    name: custom-inline-plugin
    version: 0.1.0
    patches:
    superset-extra-assets: |
        - file_name: my-dashboard.yaml
            dashboard_title: "..."
            ...
        - file_name: my-chart.yaml
            slice_name: "..."
            ...
        - file_name: my-database.yaml
            database_name: "..."
            ...
        - file_name: my-dataset.yaml
            table_name: "..."
            ...

The patch is expected to be a list of assets with an extra attribute called ``file_name`` ,
so you can pass multiple assets separated as a **yaml** list item. Each asset is expected
to be a valid yaml file with the attributes that superset expects for each asset type.

Override superset default assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to override the default assets provided by OARS you can do so by using the
patch defined above and make sure that the uuid of the asset you are overriding matches
the one in the default assets. You can find the uuid of the default assets in the
default `assets.yaml`_ file.

.. _assets.yaml: https://github.com/openedx/tutor-contrib-oars/tree/main/tutoroars/templates/oars/apps/superset/pythonpath/assets.yaml


Sharing Charts and Dashboards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To share your charts with others in the community, use Superset's "Export" button to
save a zip file of your charts and related datasets.

.. note::
    The exported datasets will contain hard-coded references to your particular
    databases, including your database hostname, port, and username, but it
    will not contain passwords.

To import charts or dashboards shared by someone in the community:

#. Expand the zip file and look for any files added under ``databases``.
   Update the ``sqlalchemy_uri`` to match your database's connection details.
#. Compress the files back into a ``.zip`` file.
#. On the Charts or Dashboards page, use the "Import" button to upload your ``.zip`` file.


Contributing Charts and Dashboards to OARS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Superset assets provided by OARS can be found in the templated `assets.yaml`_ file.
For the most part, these files what Superset exports, but with some crucial differences
which make these assets usable across all Tutor deployments.

To contribute assets to OARS:

#. Export the assets you want to contribute as described in `Sharing Charts and Dashboards`
#. Expand the ``.zip`` file.
#. Update any database connection strings to use Tutor configuration template variables
   instead of hard-coded strings, e.g. replace ``clickhouse`` with ``{{CLICKHOUSE_HOST}}``.
   Passwords can be left as ``{{CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD}}``, though be aware that if you are adding new 
   databases, you'll need to update ``SUPERSET_DB_PASSWORDS`` in the init scripts.
   Here is the default connection string for reference::

    ``clickhousedb+connect://{{OARS_CLICKHOUSE_REPORT_USER}}:{{OARS_CLICKHOUSE_REPORT_PASSWORD}}@{{CLICKHOUSE_HOST}}:{% if CLICKHOUSE_SECURE_CONNECTION%}{{CLICKHOUSE_HTTPS_PORT}}{% else %}{{CLICKHOUSE_HTTP_PORT}}{% endif %}/{{OARS_XAPI_DATABASE}}``
#. Remove any ``metadata.yaml`` files from the export. We generate these as needed during import.
#. Merge your exported files into the directories and files in the `assets.yaml`_.
#. Submit a PR with screenshots of your new chart or dashboards, along with an explanation
   of what data question they answer.
